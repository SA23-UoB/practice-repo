# practice-repo
My first practice repository

## About
I set this repo up because Patricia made me do it.

### Issues
I really don't understand what an OctoCat is, but I hope it is not some kind of *horrific* Frankenstein-like experiment.

#### Summary
I think I am gradually learning how to use Github, even though I may never understand what an OctoCat has to do with it.
